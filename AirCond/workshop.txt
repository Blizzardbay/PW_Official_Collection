title=Working Air Conditioners
description=Mod allows players to activate air conditioners for heating purposes.

description=AC units cannot be crafted, but you can find them in game already installed on some building walls. You can pick them up and place on the walls of your base.

description=To activate the air conditioner no skills or tools are needed. First you need to "Attach" the AC unit to the power grid. After that, simply select "Turn on" option which is available only if you have power on (could be generator or general power before the shutdown).

description=Then turned on, the a/c unit will generate heat in the room behind the wall it is placed on (2 squares). Click "Settings" to access a panel to change temperature and fan speed. Assuming you are indoors, the temperature will reach approximately the level according to your setting, and the fan speed will determine effectivneess of the propagation of the heat as well as generated noise volume.
