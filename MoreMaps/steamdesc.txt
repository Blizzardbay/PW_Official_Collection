[h1]Lootable map items of modded map locations: (122 mods) (77 new) [/h1]
See the discussion: "List of lootable map items of modded locations".

[hr][/hr]

Some mods have not added the ingame map feature to their map zones yet, so I can't make map items for them.
Once they have mapped their mod, I will add the corresponding item (if they haven't already).

[h1]WARNING : READ THIS[/h1]
If you want to use one of these maps items:
Eerie Country maps, Slocan Lake maps, Fort Knox linked to Eerie Country, West Point Expansion, Glenport,
you will need the mod : "IngameMaps" by alree_unjammer.
