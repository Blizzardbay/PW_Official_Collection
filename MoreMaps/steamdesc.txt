[h1]Sandbox Settings[/h1]
Lootable map items can be removed through Sandbox Settings if you don't think a specific location should have a map.
[b]Note:[/b] If the related mod is not enabled, the related lootable map items will be automatically be removed, EVEN if the tickbox is checked.

Also, a loot multiplier is available to tweak how the maps' loot chances. 
If you enable the Louisville District Maps option, the vanilla Louisville maps spawn chance will be heavily nerfed

Maps can be removed from Foraging tables as well.

Some mods have not added the ingame map feature to their map zones yet, so I can't make map items for them.
Once they have mapped their mod, I will add the corresponding item (if they haven't already).

[h1]WARNING : READ THIS[/h1]
If you want to use one of these map items:
Eerie Country maps, Slocan Lake maps, Fort Knox linked to Eerie Country, West Point Expansion, Glenport
you will need the mod : "IngameMaps" by alree_unjammer.

Some mods (Bedford Falls, Pineville, Taylorsville, Trelai, Monmouth County, St Bernard's Hill...) already have a lootable map item. When that's the case, I add it to the loot tables above, but only if the mod author hasn't already done so.
